# Delete Dead by Daylight intro video

This is a very simple script to easily delete the intro file by just running the Powershell file every time you install a new Dead by Daylight update.
Enter your personal **LoadingScreenPostLogin.bk2** path to the file by changing the $introLoc variable. *(<path-to-game>\DeadByDaylight\Content\Movies\AdditionalLoadingScreen)*
